> The **Carriers with Mapped Events** column displays the carriers that have a tracking event mapped for each shipment state. If a carrier does not have an event mapped for a particular state then shipments with that carrier can never assume that state, because the carrier does not have any events that correspond to it.
> 
> You should bear this information in mind when setting up shipment filters, in order to avoid setting up a filter for an state that your carriers do not use.
