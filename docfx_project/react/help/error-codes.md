## REACT Error Structure

REACT errors are split into parent and child error codes. The parent error indicates the HTTP error code that was returned, while the child error is a REACT-specific error intended to give more detail on the source of the problem.

The error object contains the following information:

* **ID** - A unique identifier for the error.
* **Code** - The "parent" error code (e.g. *400 - Validation Error*).
* **Message** - A summary of the error.
* **CorrelationId** - A unique identifier to correlate this error with any other related errors.
* **Details.Property** - The path to the affected property, where applicable.
* **Details.Code** - The "child" error (e.g. *Incorrect Number of Elements*).
* **Details.Message** - A message providing further details on the error.
* **Links** - A link to the information presented on the previous section of this page.
