# Using Simulated Tracking



---

Set up carrier connector

Register simulated_tracking property

After a short delay REACT generates tracking events & associated shipment events & returns them

Returned events can be used as POC or as means of testing integrations set up to receive tracking / shipment events

Prod examples: sp_4238450550120644608, sp_4253405941824815104, tracking_ref "sim_tracking_test"
