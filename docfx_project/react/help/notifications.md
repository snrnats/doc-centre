# Configuring Notifications

REACT's **Notifications Info** UI page enables you to set up automated email and SMS delivery notifications for your customers without any development work. To configure notifications, you'll need to set up an account with one of REACT's compatible email or SMS providers, give REACT your account details, and configure the details of the notification itself.

---

## Setting up Notification Connectors

The first step in setting up REACT notifications is to create a notification connector for one of REACT's three compatible providers: [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) (email), [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/) (SMS), and [SendGrid](https://sendgrid.com/) (email). When you create a connector to one of these providers, you provide REACT with your account details and other technical information. REACT can then use your account with the associated provider to send communications to your customers.

> <span class="note-header">Note:</span>
>
> Before you can set up a notification connector, you'll need to set up an account with the relevant provider and have your details to hand. This section explains the information you need to set up a connector to each of the providers.

To set up a new connector, select **Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Connectors**, scroll down to the **All Notification Connectors**, and click **Connect** on the connector you want to set up. See below for specific information on each provider.

Once you have set a connector up, its tile moves to the **Existing Connectors** section of the **Notification Connectors** page.

### Postmark

Before you can set up a connector to Postmark, you'll need to do the following:

1. Go the the [Postmark](https://postmarkapp.com/) site and set up an account.
2. Add Sender Signatures or Verified Domains. In order to send emails via Postmark you'll need to have a Sender Signature set up for each email address you want to send from. Alternatively, you can verify all addresses in a particular domain by setting up a Verified Domain.

    > <span class="note-header">More Information: </span>
    >
    > For more information on setting up Sender Signatures, see [this page](https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/846-how-can-i-send-on-behalf-of-my-users) of the Postmark documentation.
    >
    > For more information on setting up Verified Domains, see [this page](https://postmarkapp.com/support/article/1046-how-do-i-verify-a-domain) of the Postmark documentation.

3. Set up Postmark email templates. Any templates you set up will automatically be made available to select when you set up notifications in REACT.

### Managing Existing Connectors

**Editing Existing Notification Connectors**

To edit an existing notification connector, open the **Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Connectors** UI page and click **Edit** on the connector you want to edit.

   ![connector-edit](images/connector-edit.png) 

REACT displays the **Edit Notification Connection** page for that connector. Make the required edits and click **Save** to save your changes.

**Deactivating Existing Notification Connectors**

To deactivate an existing notification connector, open the **Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Connectors** UI page and click the **Active** toggle on the connector's tile. 

   ![deactivate](images/deactivate.png)  

The toggle switches to the **Inactive** position, confirming that the connector has been deactivated. 

Deactivating a notification connector means that REACT can no longer retrieve data from that provider. However, its configuration is saved, and the connector can be reactivated by clicking the toggle again.

**Disconnecting Existing Notification Connectors**

To permanently disconnect a connector, open the **Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Connectors** UI page and click the **Disconnect** button on the connector's tile.

   ![connector-disconnect](images/connector-disconnect.png) 

A confirmation dialog is displayed. Click **Yes** to disconnect the connector.

Disconnecting a notification connector deactivates it and deletes all of its configuration. To reinstate a disconnected notification connector you would need to set it up again as a new connector.

## Creating Notifications

Once you've created your notification connectors, you're ready to configure your notifications themselves. When you create a notification, you tell REACT what provider you'd like to use, when REACT should send the notification, and what the content of the notification should be. If required, you can also include a link to a REACT tracking page within the notification.

REACT notifications are triggered by shipment filters. Each shipment filter contains a list of shipment states and calculated events. When a shipment enters once of the filter's states or events, REACT sends any notifications using that filter as a trigger.

For example, suppose that you want to send an SMS notification to your customers when their shipment is out for delivery but appears to be late. To do this, you would set up a shipment filter with the *Out For Delivery* state and *Late* calculated event selected, and then create a Twilio notification with that filter selected as the notification's trigger.  

To create a new notification:

1. Select **Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Set Up** to display the **Notification Set Up** page.

    ![existing-notifications](images/existing-notifications.png) 

2. Click the **Add New Communication** tile. REACT displays a list of available connectors.

    ![notification-select-connector2](images/notification-select-connector2.png)

3. Select the connector you want to use for the notification, and then click **Next** to display editable fields relating to notification details.

    ![notification-create](images/notification-create.png)    

4. Enter a **Name** for the notification.
5. Select the **Shipment Filter** that you want to use as a trigger for the notification.
    > <span class="note-header">Note:</span>
    >
    > If you have not yet created the shipment filter you want to use, click **Create Shipment Filter**. REACT redirects you to the **Create & Manage Shipment Filters** page. When you have set your shipment filter up, return to the **Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Set Up** page to configure your notification. 
6. Enter your notification content. This step differs depending on whether you are setting up SMS or email notifications:
    * If you are setting up email notifications, select the SendGrid or Postmark (as applicable) email template you want to use from the **Select Email Template** drop-down list. The list is automatically populated using the templates you have set up in SendGrid / Postmark.
    
    ![notification-email-template](images/notification-email-template.png)  

    * If you are setting up Twilio SMS notifications, enter the text of your SMS into the **Enter Text for SMS** field.

    ![notification-sms-text](images/notification-sms-text.png) 

    > <span class="note-header">Note:</span>
    >
    > You can use merge tags to inject specific customer details such as names and addresses into your notifications. For more information on merge tags, see the [Using Merge Tags](#using-merge-tags) section. 

7. If required, select a REACT tracking page from the **Select Tracking Page** drop-down list. If you select a tracking page, then REACT will insert a tracking link into the notification.
    > <span class="note-header">More Information:</span>
    >
    > For more information on setting up REACT tracking pages, see the [Creating Tracking Pages](/react/help/tracking-pages.html) page.
8. If you want to activate the notification immediately after saving, select the **Activate This Notification** check box.

    If you want to save the notification without activating it, leave the **Activate This Notification** check box unselected.
9. Click **Save** to save the notification.

### Managing Existing Notifications

**Editing Existing Notifications**

To edit an existing notification, open the **Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Set Up** UI page and click **Edit** on the notification you want to edit.

   ![notification-edit](images/notification-edit.png) 

REACT displays the **Edit Notification** page for that notification. Make the required edits and click **Save** to save your changes.

**Deactivating Existing Notifications**

To deactivate an existing notification, open the **Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Set Up** UI page and click the **Active** toggle on the notification's tile. The toggle switches to the **Inactive** position, confirming that the notification has been deactivated. 

   ![notification-deactivate](images/notification-deactivate.png) 

Deactivating a notification means that REACT will no longer send it, even if shipments meet the criteria set out in its shipment filter. However, its configuration is saved, and the notification can be reactivated by clicking the toggle again.

**Disconnecting Existing Notifications**

To permanently disconnect a notification, open the **Settings > Notification Centre > Notification Set Up** UI page and click the **Disconnect** button on the notification's tile.

   ![notification-disconnect](images/notification-disconnect.png) 

A confirmation dialog is displayed. Click **Yes** to disconnect the notification.

Disconnecting a notification deactivates it and deletes all of its configuration. To reinstate a disconnected notification you would need to set it up again.

### Using Merge Tags

Merge tags enable you to personalise the notifications sent out to customers. For example, you might want to insert a customer's name or address details into the text and email sent to them,  rather than sending a generic message. 

A merge tag is a snippet of JSON that denotes the data that should be inserted into a notification, and where that data should be inserted. To use a merge tag, simply add the relevant field or fields to the text of your notification. For emails, you will need to do this in the SendGrid / Postmark UI. For SMS notifications, you would insert your merge tags into the REACT UI's **Enter Text for SMS** field.

The full merge tag structure is:

```json
{
 "Consumer": {
   "Reference": "Reference",
   "Email": "Email",
   "Phone": "Phone",
   "MobilePhone": "MobilePhone",
   "FirstName": "FirstName",
   "LastName": "LastName",
   "MiddleName": "MiddleName",
   "Title": "Title"
 },
 "TrackingPageUrl": "TrackingPageUrl",
 "Key1": "Value1",
 "Key2": "Value2"
}
```

In practice, you would probably use merge tags one field at a time, rather than as a single JSON object. For example, you might enter the following example as notification text:

Hi `{{Consumer.FirstName}}`! Your package is on its way. To keep an eye on it, go to `{{TrackingPageUrl}}`.

> <span class="note-header">Note:</span>
>
> When configuring Twilio notifications, the `TrackingPageUrl` property _only_ requires triple curly brackets, rather than the standard double curly brackets. For Twilio, you would need to enter the above example as:
>
> Hi `{{Consumer.FirstName}}`! Your package is on its way. To keep an eye on it, go to `{{{TrackingPageUrl}}}`.

The metadata keys at the bottom enable you to further customise the information available in your notifications by adding metadata from your shipments. For example, supposed that you register a shipment with a `Contents` metadata property, which you use to supply a description of the shipment contents, as follows:

<div class="tab">
    <button class="staticTabButton">Metadata Example</button>
    <div class="copybutton" onclick="CopyToClipboard(this, 'metadataExample')"><span class='glyphicon glyphicon-copy'></span><span class='copy'>Copy</span></div>
</div>

<div id="metadataExample" class="staticTabContent" onclick="CopyToClipboard(this, 'metadataExample')">


```json
      "metadata": [
        {
          "key": "Contents",
          "value": "Shoes",
          "type": "String"
        },
      ],
```

</div>

You could then further enhance your notification by adding shipment contents to the text. For example:

Hi `{{Consumer.FirstName}}`! The package with your `{{Contents}}` in is on its way. To keep an eye on it, go to `{{TrackingPageUrl}}`.

> <span class="note-header">More Information:</span>
>
> Merge tags can only display information about a shipment if that shipment has the relevant information registered. In the example above, this would require you to register a customer's first name, and a `Contents` metadata property. 
>
> For more information on registering shipment data, including setting up metadata, see the [Registering Shipments](/react/help/registering-shipments.html) page.
