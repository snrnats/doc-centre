# Integration Guide

SortedREACT's APIs enable you to integrate REACT functionality into your own systems and sites. This section explains how to call REACT's API endpoints.

## Calling REACT's APIs

To call any of the APIs, you'll need an API key. You can create one from the **Settings** > **API Keys** tab in the REACT UI.

> <span class="note-header">Note:</span>
>
> For more information on getting a REACT API key, see the [Setting up API keys](/react/help/settings.html#setting-up-api-keys) section of the **Settings** page.

To use your API key, include it in an `x-api-key` header when making an API call. We also recommend that you include JSON `Content-Type` and `Accept` headers too, as REACT only works with JSON data.
