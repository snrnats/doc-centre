## Shipping Cost Over Time by Carrier

The **Shipping Cost Over Time by Carrier** chart shows how your daily shipping costs with each carrier have changed over time. Each line on the graph represents one of your carriers.

### Visual Filters

You can filter the data displayed on the **Shipping Cost Over Time by Carrier** table using the following filters:

* **Carrier Name** ([Basic](/reports/filters-options.html#using-basic-filters) and [Advanced](/reports/filters-options.html#using-advanced-filters)) - enables you to select a carrier or carriers whose services you want to view.
* **Date Shipped** ([Basic](/reports/filters-options.html#using-basic-filters), [Advanced](/reports/filters-options.html#using-advanced-filters), and [Relative Date](/reports/filters-options.html#using-relative-date-filters)) - enables you to select specific shipped dates or date ranges to view.
* **Parcel Charges** ([Numerical](/reports/filters-options.html#using-numerical-filters)) - enables you to filter by per-carrier per-day spend. For example, if you were to filter on *is greater than 10000*, then any data points in which you had spent £9999 or less with a particular carrier on a particular day would be ignored. In this example, the y-axis of the graph is effectively skewed so that it starts at 10000 rather than 0.
