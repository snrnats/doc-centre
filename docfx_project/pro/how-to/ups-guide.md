# Client Onboarding Guide for UPS (EU/US)

Sorted are an approved UPS Ready provider. This means that we can provide our customers with the ability to ship products with UPS using SortedPRO without the need for any separate customer certification process. 

This page explains how to configure UPS Ready functionality within PRO.

## Configuring UPS Ready

In order to use UPS Ready functionality within PRO, you will need to register your UPS account number. This step must be completed by Sorted customers as part of the onboarding process, as each customer must accept the terms and conditions of the UPS Technology Agreement (UTA).

To register a new UPS account Number within PRO:

1. Open the PRO UI ([Production](https://web.electioapp.com/) or [Sandbox](https://websandbox.electioapp.com/)) and log in. Select **Settings** to display the **Settings** page.

### Configuring US Domestic EDI Tracking

US Domestic Services use an EDI tracking solution (as apposed to API). Therefore, you will need to take some additional steps in order to accept the UPS Technology Agreement (UTA) .

The quickest way to onboard UPS EDI services is to sign up for the UPS EDI Click Wrap process. To do so:

1. Contact your local UPS Account Manager, who should submit a request for the process via UPS.com. UPS will respond by sending you an email link.

2. Click the link, log into UPS.com, and approve the UTA by clicking the relevant check box. 

Alternatively, you can approve the UTA via EDI questionnaire. This is a manual process involving UPS's legal teams, and will take much longer than the EDI Click Wrap process.

Once you have approve the UTA, UPS will set up a tracking account via Open Text, their 3rd party provider, and share the relevant SFTP tracking credentials with us.
