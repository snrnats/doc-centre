# Release Note - 26/05/20

We are releasing a number of enhancements to our standard SortedPRO reports. Most of these are background changes to improve performance and scalability, but some affect the PRO user interface or report outputs.
Please see below for more details of these enhancements.

## Custom Report 

### Report Filters

We have streamlined the UI in the **Report Filters** section by removing some little-used parameters. The greyed-out parameters are no longer accessible.  
This is to improve the overall user experience and efficiency of reporting.

### Shipped From

The **Shipped From** filter now shows only the shipping locations to which the requesting user has access:

### Date filters

In order to improve efficiency, you must now select at least one date filter when viewing custom reports.
