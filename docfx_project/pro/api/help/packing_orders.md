# Creating Consignments From Orders

Packing orders into shippable consignments is the final step in the Orders process. This page explains how to create consignments from an order.

---

## Using Pack Order

The **Pack Order** endpoint enables you to take those items on an order that share an origin and are to be shipped together, and generate a shippable consignment from them. You will need to send one **Pack Order** request per consignment that you want to create from the order.

To call **Pack Order**, send a `POST` request to `https://api.electioapp.com/orders/{orderReference}/pack`. At a minimum, the body of the request should contain the `{orderReference}` of the associated order and details of at least one `{item}` (and its accompanying `{package}`). The items and packages listed make up the consignment. If required, you can also populate the resulting consignment with a custom order reference and additional `MetaData`, `CustomsDocumentation`, and `Tags`.

Each item must be identified by a `Reference`, an `ItemReferenceProvidedByCustomer`, or a `Sku`. These fields are not mandatory in themselves, but one of them must be present for each item.

>
> PRO validates the items on a <strong>Pack Order</strong> request against its associated order. For example, the system will return an error if you make a <strong>Pack Order</strong> request including an item with a <code>Sku</code> of <em>12345</em> if there is no item with that <code>Sku</code> on the corresponding order.
>
> However, PRO does not validate the items on a <strong>Pack Order</strong> request against previous <strong>Pack Order</strong> requests. As such, you should be careful to ensure that you do not pack the same item into more than one consignment.

Once SortedPRO has received a **Pack Order** request, it creates the consignment and returns the relevant `{consignmentReference}`. The consignment's details are taken from the body of the **Pack Order** request. Fields that are not part of the request (because they are either NULL or not part of the **Pack Order** request structure) are populated from the details of the specified order.

### Providing a Custom Order Reference 

The **Pack Order** request's `OrderReferenceProvidedByCustomer` field enables you to provide a custom reference for the consignment that the request generates. This is a separate field to the `OrderReferenceProvidedByCustomer` used on the order itself, and behaves in the following ways:

* If you add a custom reference to your **Pack Order** request, then PRO uses this value as the consignment's custom reference, even if there is a different custom reference on the order itself. 
* If you do not add a custom reference to your **Pack Order** request, but the order does have a custom reference, then PRO populates the resulting consignment's `OrderReferenceProvidedByCustomer` using value from the order
* If neither the order or the **Pack Order** request has a custom reference specified, then PRO creates the consignment without a custom reference. 

### Generating Return Consignments

You can automatically generate a return consignment at the same time as well as an outbound consignment by using the `GenerateReturn` flag. When PRO receives a **Pack Order request that has** `GenerateReturn` set to _true_, it creates and returns two consignments - one outbound and one inbound.

The inbound consignment is identical to the outbound consignment, with the exception that its _Origin_ and _Destination_ addresses are swapped.

### Pack Order Example

The example shows a **Pack Order** request to create a consignment with one package containing a single item from order _EO-000-002-0TT_. PRO creates the consignment and responds with a `{consignmentReference}` of _EC-000-05B-MQ4_.
