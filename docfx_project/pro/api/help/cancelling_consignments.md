# Cancelling Consignments

This page explains how to cancel consignments in PRO, both individually and in bulk.

---

## Overview

You can only cancel a consignment prior to it being manifested. Once a consignment has been manifested it can no longer be cancelled. 

Once a consignment has been cancelled, then no further changes can be made to it. If you want to reinstate a cancelled consignment then you will need to create a new consignment with the same details.

## Cancelling Individual Consignments

To cancel an individual consignment, use the **Cancel Consignment** endpoint. You can call **Cancel Consignment** by sending a `PUT` request to `https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/{consignmentReference}/cancel`. Once the request has been received, PRO changes the consignment's `ConsignmentState` to _Cancelled_ and returns a code 200 response with no body.

## Cancelling Consignments in Bulk

If you need to cancel multiple consignments in one operation, use the **Cancel Consignments** endpoint. You can call **Cancel Consignments** by sending a `PUT` request to `https://api.electioapp.com/consignments/cancellist`. The body of the request should comprise an array listing the `consignmentReference`s of the consignments you want to cancel.

Once the request has been received, PRO changes the each consignment's `consignmentState` to _Cancelled_ and returns a list with a confirmation message in it for each consignment.
