## What Is a Quote In PRO?

In PRO, delivery quotes are generally used outside of a "regular" consignment allocation workflow, as a means of managing consignments that require manual intervention. For example, your customer service teams might want to get quotes for an expedited delivery on a consignment that was missed by a carrier and so did not meet its delivery promise.

PRO's Quotes API enables you to get delivery quotes for both as-yet uncreated and existing consignments. All Quotes endpoints return one or more `Quote` objects, of which each represents an offer for carriage of a consignment with a specific carrier service. Each quote can be uniquely identified by a `{quoteReference}`, which is used when selecting a quote via the **Allocate With Quote** endpoint.
