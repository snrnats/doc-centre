# Getting Quotes for an Existing Consignment

This page explains how to get delivery quotes for a consignment that already exists in PRO.

---

The **Get Quotes By Consignment Reference** endpoint returns quotes based on the details of an existing consignment. Specifically, it takes a `{consignmentReference}` and returns an array of `{Quotes}` for that consignment. 

To call **Get Quotes by Consignment Reference**, send a `GET` request to `https://api.electioapp.com/quotes/consignment/{consignmentReference}`.

Once it has received the request, PRO returns a quote result. The quote result object includes two lists: one containing `Quotes` and one containing `UnqualifiedServices` (that is, services that have been disqualified from the quote process or that did not meet the delivery requirements for the consignment and were therefore unable to provide a quote). 

Each `Quote` object contains the following information:

* A unique reference for the quote. This value is important, as it is used when allocating consignments to the quote via the **Allocate With Quote** endpoint.
* Creation and expiry dates
* The name and reference of the relevant carrier and carrier service
* Origin and destination addresses
* Collection date, and a delivery date range
* Pricing information
* Details on each leg of the journey (where applicable)
* The service direction

At this point, you would be able to display the relevant quote information to your customer service operative.

### Get Quotes by Consignment Reference Example

The example shows a **Get Quotes by Consignment Reference** request and its accompanying response. In this case, SortedPRO has returned two quotes for the service. The next step in the process is to select one of those quotes.
