# Managing Shipments

Content

Significant differences:

- New dates for shipping
- link to label in object
- New shipment type field denoting whether its on demand or scheduled. This changes the validation when creating a shipment so probably needs its own section
- packages / items now transmuted into contents
- shipment groups could mean that each order breaks down to multiple shipments as opposed to one consignment (?)
- label properties
- reservations for pickup
