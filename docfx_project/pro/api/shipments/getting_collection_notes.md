# Getting Collection Notes

Get Shipment Group Collection Note

This endpoint allows the user to retrieve a `collection_note` for a `shipment_group` by using the reference of the `shipment_group`.

In addition to the endpoint that utilises Sortedâ€™s unique `shipment_group` reference to return a `collection_note`, the API must also support using the customer's own `custom_reference` and `version` for a `shipment_group`.

this endpoint should automatically determine the latest `version` of a `shipment_group` with the specified `custom_reference` if the version parameter is specified as `latest`.

The `latest` `version` will always be the `shipment_group` with the **highest** `version` that *also* has the provided `custom_reference` and is registered for the customer making the query.
