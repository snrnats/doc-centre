In the context of SortedPRO, a "pickup option" is a delivery date, pickup location and a carrier service that could meet that delivery promise for a consignment. The **[Pickup Options](https://docs.electioapp.com/#/api/PickupOptions)** endpoint takes the details of the (as-yet uncreated) consignment and returns available pickup options.

At a minimum, SortedPRO requires you to send the following data in order to receive pickup options for a potential consignment:

* **Distance** - The maximum distance from the destination address that you want to receive results for.
* **Max Results** - The maximum number of results that you want to receive. This should be a value between one and 50.
* **Package Information**
* **Origin Address**
* **Destination Address**

The **Pickup Options** endpoint returns a `{Locations}` array containing pertinant details for each pickup location that has the capability to accept your consignment. The location's full address, distance from destination address, latitude and longitude, and opening and closing times are provided for you to surface the information in the checkout which enables your customers to chose the most convenient option for them. 

Each `{Location}` object contains a `{DeliveryOptions}` array listing the delivery promises that are available to that location for the proposed consignment. Each `{DeliveryOptions}` includes; a delivery date, a start and end time, the carrier and service, the cost of delivery and the latest shipping date and time possible to meet the promise.

The pickup options available for a given consignment can change over time and should therefore be treated an dynamic. This is primarily due to differnet carriers collecting at differnet times at each shipping location or the pickup locations provider updating the list of active locations. Pickup locations are classified as either finite or infinate capacity. In the case of finite capcity the locations provider may disable or enable a location at any time as demand for the locatation dictates. Sorted strongly advise that location details are never cached for re-use in the web store or checkout due to the dynamic nature of the information.

> <span class="note-header">More Information:</span>
> * For full reference information on the <strong>Pickup Options</strong> endpoint, see the <strong><a href="https://docs.electioapp.com/#/api/PickupOptions">Pickup Options</a></strong> page of the API reference.
> * For a user guide on pickup options, see the [Getting Pickup Options](/pro/api/help/getting_pickup_options.html) page.

### Pickup Options Example

The example shows a request to get no more than 10 pickup options for a fairly standard consignment, all within 1km of the recipient's location.

The API has returned one location that meets the requested criteria, and three options for delivery to that location. All three options use the same carrier service and have a delivery time window of 09:30 - 17:30, but are scheduled for different days. In practice, PRO is saying that the carrier can deliver to the pickup location during business hours on the 17th, 20th or 21st of May (as required by the customer).

Note the `{Reference}` for each pickup option. When the customer selects their preferred pickup option you will need to pass the relevant `{Reference}` back to PRO via the **Select Option** endpoint.

At this point, you would present some or all of the options returned to your customer via your site or app. In the next step, we'll see how to handle the choice the customer makes.
