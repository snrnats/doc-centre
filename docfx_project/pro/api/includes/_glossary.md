Carrier Booking can also be described as the all communication related to allocating and manifesting a consignment|

The dimensional weight divisor varies by service offering and unit of measure|
|​​​Dimension range|​​​​​A range of dimensions (min & max of length, width & height) of a shipment item that can be shipped via a Carrier|

Hazardous material may include: an explosive, radioactive material, etiologic agent, flammable or combustible liquid or solid, poison, oxidizing or corrosive material, and compressed gas​​​​|
|Hub|A Hub is a sorting facility where shipments are sorted and distributed to other Hubs or depot locations|
|​​​​Import Duty​|​​Import duty is applied by a country's customs. Import duty is calculated based upon the tariff code of each product contained within the shipment. Each country sets varying levels of import duty depending on the product. Exemptions do apply to certain products and types of shipments. For example, gifts and personal effects are often exempt from import duty if they are under a certain value threshold​​​|
|Inbound|A shipment that is going back to the retailer rather than the purchaser. Usually indicates a 'Return' service|
|​Item​​​|​A distinct piece collected by a Picker in a warehouse to fulfil and order. A number of items may be consolidated into one order, which may comprise of one or more packages.

|Label| Printed information that is affixed to a package. The label must be visible,  legible where required, and with barcodes that can be read according to the Carrier's requirements (and machinery). SortedPRO can use ZPL, PNG and PDF​ formats, although ZPL is preferred to be received/sent due to its smaller data size. ​Labels tend to come in standard sizes, with the most common being 6" x 4" (152.4mm x 101.6mm). Labels may also be 8" x 4" (203.2mm x 101.6mm), or variants of standard paper sizes (A4/5/6, where each increment is half the size of the previous)​​​|
|Manifest|A manifest is an electronic document containing shipment data that is exchanged between business partners. For example, a manifest file may be sent at the EoD from SortedPRO to a Carrier, and this file may contain details on many shipments. For API files, shipments may also be manifested individually, usually when a label is created|
|​​​Metadata|​​Not all the data that a Client needs to pass to a carrier may map directly to an existing SortedPRO field. As a result, clients can add custom data (known as metadata) to a given shipment, which can then be passed on to Sorted. It is not normally processed by PRO|
|Net Weight|The weight of an item without packaging or container. Also applies to the contents of a shipping container, truck or van|
