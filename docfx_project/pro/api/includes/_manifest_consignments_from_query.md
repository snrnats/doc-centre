Once you've created a consignment, allocated it to a carrier service and printed labels for it, you're ready to manifest it. To manifest a consignment, use the **[Manifest Consignments From Query](https://docs.electioapp.com/#/api/ManifestConsignmentsFromQuery)** endpoint. In the context of SortedPRO, the term "manifest" refers to advising the carrier that the consignment in question needs to be collected from the shipper.

The **Manifest Consignments From Query** endpoint enables you to use a query to select consignments to be manifested. Once PRO has attempted to add those consignments to the manifest queue, the **Manifest Consignments From Query** endpoint returns a `Message` indicating how many consignments met the terms of the query and how many it was able to queue.

### Manifest Consignments From Query Example

The example shows a request to manifest all consignments that are allocated to Carrier X, shipping from a location with the `ShippingLocationReference` _Location1_, and have already had their labels printed. The response indicates that PRO found 10 consignments meeting these criteria, and that all 10 were successfully queued for manifest.
