To allocate one or more consignments to a specific carrier service, use the **[Allocate With Carrier Service](https://docs.electioapp.com/#/api/AllocateWithCarrierService)** endpoint. 

The **Allocate With Carrier Service** request body contains an array of one or more `{consignmentReference}`s to be allocated and the `{MpdCarrierServiceReference}` of the carrier service that they should be allocated to. Once the request is received, SortedPRO attempts to allocate the consignments to the specified carrier service.
