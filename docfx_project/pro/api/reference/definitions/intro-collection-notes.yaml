  # Introduction

  This specification relates to the retrieval of collection notes.

  A collection note is a document that lists all shipments that are due to be collected by the same carrier at the same time. This can be used, for example,
  for a driver to sign to confirm the contents of a collection.

  > Note: All paths in this document are relative to `{scheme}://{host}/collection_notes`.

  This API is documented in [OpenAPI format v3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/). If you spot any errors in this documentation, please drop us an email at [support@sorted.com](mailto:support@sorted.com).

  # Errors

  The Shipments API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of each API call. The body of an unsuccessful response will be in JSON in the following format:

  ```json
  {
    "correlation_id": "6c4e6a77-feab-42ab-9d7b-f559dc1b90ca",
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "A provided property has an invalid format",
    "details": [
      {
        "property": "path",
        "code": "invalid_format",
        "message": "'sp_1234' is not a valid shipment reference"
      }
    ],
    "_links": [
      {
        "href": "https://api.sorted.com/pro/api/shipments/errors/400_invalid_format.html",
        "rel": "documentation",
        "reference": "invalid_format"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

  # Authentication
                                                
  This API requires an API key of `x-api-key` with every request.
                                                
  You will receive an initial API key your account is created. Requests _without_ an `x-api-key` header will be rejected with a `401 Access Denied` response.
