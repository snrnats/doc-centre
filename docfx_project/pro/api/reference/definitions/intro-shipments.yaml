  # Introduction

  PRO's Shipments functionality was introduced as an extension to the previous Consignments API suite. PRO's Shipments API collection offers unparalleled flexibility, with support for on-demand collections from multiple locations (e.g. a ship-from-store model) as well the regular scheduled fulfilment centre collections supported by Consignments.

  Shipments also offers the ability to group shipments together for ease of management, an improved dangerous goods specification and enhanced customs functionality, among many other features.
                                                
  All API calls require a valid `x-api-key` header to be provided; without this header you will receive a `401 Unauthorised` response.
                                                
  This API is documented in [OpenAPI format v3.0](https://swagger.io/specification/). If you spot any errors in this documentation, please drop us an email at [support@sorted.com](mailto:support@sorted.com).
                                                
  # Errors
                                                
  The Shipments API uses standard HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of each API call. The body of an unsuccessful response will be in JSON in the following format:
                                                
  ```json
  {
    "correlation_id": "6c4e6a77-feab-42ab-9d7b-f559dc1b90ca",
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "A provided property has an invalid format",
    "details": [
      {
        "property": "addresses[0].contact.contact_details.email",
        "code": "invalid_format",
        "message": "'test@something' is not a valid email address"
      }
    ],
  "_links": [

        "href": "https://api.sorted.com/pro/api/shipments/errors/400_invalid_format.html",
        "rel": "documentation",
        "reference": "invalid_format" 
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
                                               
  # Authentication
                                                
  This API requires an API key of `x-api-key` with every request.
                                                
  You will receive an initial API key your account is created. Requests _without_ an `x-api-key` header will be rejected with a `401 Access Denied` response.

  # Content Types
                                                
  The Sorted Shipments API supports `application/json` only.
                                                
  All requests should include the following headers:
                                                
  | Required Header | Value |

  # Compression
                                                
  The Sorted Shipments API supports `gzip` compression which can be enabled with the following header:
                                                
  | Header | Value |
