If you only require\r\nallocation of a single `shipment`, you should prefer the single Allocate Shipment endpoint.\r\n            \r\nWhen allocating using this endpoint, Sorted will automatically determine the most appropriate carrier service based on\r\nseveral factors, including:\r\n            \r\n- Configured shipping rules\r\n- Configured shipping modes\r\n- Required shipping dates (if specified)\r\n- Required delivery dates (if specified)\r\n- Carrier availability\r\n- Carrier service price"
