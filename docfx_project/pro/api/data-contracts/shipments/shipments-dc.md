# Data Contracts

This section of the site lists all data contracts applicable to Sorted's public Shipments APIs.

> [!CAUTION]
> Changing API data contracts may **only** include the addition of new, optional properties. Once a data contract has been communicated to customers, the contract cannot be changed. You can consider data contracts open for extension, but closed for modification.

## Accessibility

Indicates the `accessibility` of dangerous goods during transport.

| Value | Description |
|------ | ------------|
| `accessible` | The goods are accessible (e.g. for inspection) |
| `inaccessible` | The goods are **not** accessible (e.g. for inspection) |

## Accessibility Rules

This object allows a customer to specify which type(s) of accessibility are explicitly included or excluded from this `ruleset`.

> [!NOTE]
> If no accessibility rules are provided, then any type of accessibility is permitted according to this `ruleset`.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Validation | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | :--------: |
| `include` | List of [`accessibility`](#accessibility) | The accessibility value(s) to include in this `ruleset` (allow) | Optional. If provided, must be a valid `accessibility`. If `exclude` is provided, then `include` must be `null` or empty. | `0..4` |
| `exclude` | List of [`accessibility`](#accessibility) | The accessibility value(s) to exclude from this `ruleset` (disallow) | Optional. If provided, must be a valid `accessibility`. If `include` is provided, then `exclude` must be `null` or empty. | `0..4` |

## Address

Each `shipment` must have at least 2 addresses: one of type `origin` and one of type `destination`. Other `address_types` are optional.

> [!NOTE]
> The required properties of an address differ based on the `shipment_type`. Any `on_demand` type `shipments` do **not** require a valid `shipping_location_reference`, whereas `scheduled` type `shipments` require either the `origin` or `destination` address to be a valid shipping location.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Validation | Occurrence |

### Address JSON Examples

The following example shows an `address` that utilises the `shipping_location_reference` property to reference a pre-existing shipping location address:

```json
{
    "address_type": "origin",
    "shipping_location_reference": "SLOC001"
}

```

The following example shows a complete address that does not use a `shipping_location_reference`:

```json
{
    "address_type": "destination",
    "shipping_location_reference": null,
    "custom_reference": "21bbd58a-6dec-4097-9106-17501ddca38d",
    "contact": {
        "reference": "co_9953035290535460865888900000987",
        "title": "Mr",
        "first_name": "Steve",
        "last_name": "Kingston",

            "mobile": "+447495747987",
            "email": "steve@kingston.com"
        }
    },
    "property_number": "8",
    "property_name": null,
    "address_line_1": "Norbert Road",
    "address_line_2": "Bertwistle",
    "address_line_3": null,
    "locality": "Preston",
    "region": "Lancashire",
    "postal_code": "PR4 5LE",
    "country_iso_code": "GB",
    "lat_long": null
}

```

## Address Type

Indicates the type of an address. All addresses must include a valid type from this list.

> [!WARNING]
> This list of values may be extended at any time without prior notice. Your application should not be coded in such a way that an addition to the list causes a breaking change.

| Value | Description |
|------ | ------------|
| `origin` | The `origin` of a `shipment` (i.e. where it is being shipped from) |
| `destination` | The final `destination` of a `shipment` (i.e. where it is being shipped to) |
| `return` | The address that a `shipment` should be returned to |
| `sender` | The address of the sender, if different to the `origin` |
| `recipient` | The address of the recipient, if different to the `destination` |
| `importer` | The address of the importer, if applicable |
| `billing` | The billing address, if different to the `destination` and `recipient` |

## Allocate Request

An `allocate_request` is used to request allocation of one or more `shipments` with a carrier. This object is intended for use when allowing Sorted's allocation engine to determine the most appropriate carrier based on:

- Configured allocation/shipment rules;
- Carrier availability for required shipping and delivery date(s); and
- The prices of each carrier service

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Validation | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | :--------: |
| `shipments` | List of `string` | The reference(s) of `shipment(s)` to be allocated. | Required. At least one valid reference must be provided. A maximum of `100` `shipments` can be allocated at once using this method. This is to ensure the continued optimal performance of the Sorted platform. | `1.100` |
| `capabilities` | [`service_capabilities`](#service-capabilities) | Any specific capabilities that are required as part of the allocation. | Optional. See [`service_capabilities`](#service-capabilities). | `0..1` |

</div>

### Allocate Request JSON Example

An `allocate_request` is used to allocate one or more `shipments` using pre-configured shipping rules â€“ Sorted's allocation engine will automatically determine the optimal service for allocation.

```json
{
    "shipments": [
        "sp_10014418679662051328667654221112",
        "sp_10014418692546953216098308745978",

        "sp_10014418709726822400232323009988"
    ]
}
```

## Allocate Result

An `allocate_result` is returned for all requests to allocate a `shipment`. The object contains details of the operation result, as well as details of the allocation or, in the case of a failed allocation, details of the allocation failure.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |

        }
    ]
}
```

## Allocate Shipments Result

An `allocate_shipments_result` is returned when multiple `shipments` are allocated. The differs from a standard [`allocate_result`](#allocate-result) as this operation is asynchronous i.e. it is performed as a background task within SortedPRO.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | :--------: |
| `message` | `string` | A plain text message describing the result of the operation | `1` |
| `queued` | List of `string` | The references of the `shipments` that have been successfully queued for allocation | `0..n` |
| `rejected` | List of [`allocation_rejection`](#allocation-rejection) | Details of `shipments` that have been rejected for allocation. | `0..n` |
| `_links` | List of [`link`](#link) | Links to any relevant resources | `0..n` |

</div>

## Allocate with Carrier Service Request

The `allocate_with_carrier_service_request` is designed to facilitate allocating one or more `shipments` with a specific carrier service. The cheapest available option for that carrier service will automatically be selected using this method.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | :--------: |
| `shipments` | List of `string` | The reference(s) of the `shipment(s)` to be allocated. | Required. At least one valid reference must be provided. A maximum of `100` `shipments` can be allocated at once using this method. This is to ensure continued optimal performance of the Sorted platform. | `1..100` |

| `capabilities` | [`service_capabilities`](#service-capabilities) | Any specific capabilities that are required as part of the allocation. | Optional. See [`service_capabilities`](#service-capabilities). | `0..1` |

</div>

### Allocate with Carrier Service Request JSON Example

An `allocate_with_carrier_service_request` is very similar to an `allocate_request`, but also include the `carrier_service` to allocate with:

```json

    ],
    "carrier_service_reference": "DDF_ND24"
}
```

## Allocate with Filters Request

The `allocate_with_filters_request` is designed to allow a flexible method for allocating `shipments`.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Validation | Occurrence |

        "drop_off": true
    }
}
```

## Allocate with Filters Result

An `allocate_with_filters_result` provides details of `shipments` identified and submitted for allocation by an [`allocate_with_filters_request`](#allocate-with-filters-request).

<div class="contract">

        }
    ],
    "message": "Shipments queued for allocation successfully"
}
```

## Allocate with Service Group Request

The `allocate_with_service_group_request` is designed to facilitate allocating one or more `shipments` with a carrier from a specific service group. A `service_group` is a collection of one or more carrier services that you can configure. The cheapest available service in a group will automatically be selected using this method.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | :--------: |
| `shipments` | List of `string` | The reference(s) of the `shipment(s)` to be allocated. | Required. At least one valid reference must be provided. A maximum of `100` `shipments` can be allocated at once using this method. This is to ensure continued optimal performance of the Sorted platform. | `1..100` |
| `service_group` | `string` | The reference of the carrier service group to allocate the `shipments` with. | Required. Must be a valid reference for an existing `service_group` within your account | `1` |
| `capabilities` | [`service_capabilities`](#service-capabilities) | Any specific capabilities that are required as part of the allocation. | Optional. See [`service_capabilities`](#service-capabilities). | `0..1` |

</div>

### Allocate with Service Group JSON Example

An `allocate_with_service_group_request` includes both a list of `shipment` references and the reference of the `service_group` to allocate with:

```json
{
    "shipments": [
        "sp_10014418679662051328777876543233",
        "sp_10014418692546953216982387628936",

        "sp_10014418709726822400453450009232"
    ],
    "service_group ": "BAW_PREM_01"
}
```

## Allocation

The `allocation` object provides details of the active allocation for a `shipment`, if applicable. A `shipment` will only have an *active* allocation when the `shipment` has been allocated to a carrier service for delivery/collection. Any `shipment` that has not yet been allocated will have a `null` value for allocation.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |

| `_links` | List of [`link`](#link) | Links to related resources, such as labels. | `0..n` |

</div>

### Allocation JSON Example

The `allocation` object provides details of which carrier and carrier service have been assigned to a `shipment`. The `price` of the service, the resulting `tracking_references` and the date and time of allocation are also included:

## Allocation Filters

The `allocation_filters` object is used to selectively pre-filter carrier services prior to executing an allocation.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Validation | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | :--------: |
| `direction` | [`direction`](#direction) | The `direction` property of the carrier services to select. | Required. Must be a valid [`direction`](#direction). | `1` |
| `tags` | List of `string` | Filters carrier services to exclude any services that do not have a 100% tag match. All tags will be considered, and a service must have all the provided tags. | Optional. If provided, must contain `>= 1` and `<= 10` tags. | `0..10` |
| `pickup` | `boolean` | Indicates whether to include pick-up services or not (i.e. services where the consumer will collect the `shipment` from a location) | Optional. Will default to `false` if not provided. | `0..1` |

</div>

## Allocation Rejection

This object is returned as part of an [`allocate_shipments_result`](#allocate-shipments-result) when one or more `shipments` have been rejected for allocation. Rejection can occur for a number of reasons. For example, a `shipment` that is already in a `state` of allocated cannot be allocated.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | :--------: |
| `code` | `string` | The error code that indicates why the collection of `shipments` was rejected for allocation | `1` |
| `message` | `string` | A plain text message describing the error code | `1` |
| `references` | List of `string` | The list of shipment references that were rejected due to the specified code | `1..n` |

</div>

## API Error

This object is returned by Sorted whenever an error occurs during a request. Errors can have many causes, such as badly-formed requests, incorrect permissions, or unforeseen issues during request processing.

> [!NOTE]
> Although errors from the API include string-based messages, the message content should not be considered part of the data contract. Customers are strongly-advised not to program any application logic based on the content of an error message. Always prefer the code property, which can be considered part of a data contract, i.e. Sorted will not change error codes and will only introduce new codes.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | :--------: |
| `correlation_id` | `string` | A unique reference for this error. Customers can use this when reporting errors to Sorted, if applicable | `1` |
| `code` | `string` | A pre-defined code for this error. See [API Error Codes](./error-codes.md). | `1` |
| `message` | `string` | A plain text summary of the error. | `1` |
| `details` | List of [`api_error_message`](#api-error-message) | A collection of `api_error_messages` which provide further details of the error(s) if applicable. | `0..n` |
| `_links` | List of [`link`](#link) | Provides `links` to further relevant information of operations, if applicable. | `0..n` |

</div>

### API Error JSON Example

An `api_error` is returned when there was a problem with a request or operation:

```json
{
    "correlation_id": "6c4e6a77-feab-42ab-9d7b-f559dc1b90ca",
    "code": "validation_error",
    "message": "A provided property has an invalid format",
    "details": [
        {

## Applicable Documents

This object informs API users of `documents` that apply to a particular `shipment` or `quote`.

For example, when retrieving a `quote` for a `shipment` originating in the `GB` and being sent to `US`, one or more customs documents are likely to apply. This property allows users to understand documentation requirements in advance.

> [!TIP]
> The `applicable` property is included to allow Sorted to return "negative" responses if required. For instance, we might wish to specify that a specific document is **not** required in paperless trade scenarios. This property allows us to explicitly inform that user that a specific `document` does not apply.

<div class="contract">

| Property     | Type                              | Description                                                        | Occurrence |

## Application Type

The `application_type` identifies how a surcharge value is applied when calculating the price of the service for a `shipment`.

> [!NOTE]
> This list of values may be extended at any time without prior notice. Your application should not be coded in such a way that an addition to the list causes a breaking change.

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `none` | This is a default value provided in situations where there is no application of this surcharge. This value will not normally used but is included in the data contract to allow for situations where unusual or unexpected behaviour occurs when calculating surcharge values. |
| `standard` | This is a standard surcharge. |
| `retrospective` | The surcharge value applies retrospectively. |

## Base Application

The `base_application` object provides details of whether the value of a [`surcharge`](#surcharge) applies to the base price and, if so, whether it applies to the base price only or the base price and the combined value of other applicable surcharges.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | :--------: |
| `base` | `boolean` | Indicates whether this surcharge applies to the `base` cost. | `1` |
| `base_only` | `boolean` | Indicates whether this surcharge applies to the `base` cost only. This should never be `true` if `base` is `false`. | `1` |

</div>

## Calculation Model

The `calculation_model` determines the model for how the value of a [`surcharge`](#surcharge) is calculated.

> [!NOTE]
> This list of values may be extended at any time without prior notice. Your application should not be coded in such a way that an addition to the list causes a breaking change.

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `fixed` | The value is fixed at a particular value, regardless of the overall value of the quote. |
| `calculated` | The value is calculated based on the other factors in the surcharge and does not have a specific or fixed value. |

## Class Division

This object holds details of an IATA class division and sub-divisions. This object is used as the class divisions and sub-divisions use a numeric scheme which does not make it simple to express a specific sub-division when multiple class divisions are provided.

> ![NOTE]
> If `class_sub_divisions` is not provided, the entire `class_division` will be used as either an `include` or `exclude` rule, as appropriate.

## Contact

An address must always include a `contact`, except when the address utilises a pre-defined shipping location (which already has a `contact` defined). When providing a `shipping_location_reference` you may exclude the `contact` property, in which case the address will inherit the `contact` from the shipping location. However, you may also provide a `shipping_location_reference` *and* a `contact`, in which case the provided `contact` will supersede the `contact` from the shipping location, for the specific `shipment` only.

A `create_shipment_group_request` is used to create a new `shipment_group`.

This example creates a new `shipment_group` with a `custom_reference` and 2 `shipments`:

```json
{
    "shipments": [
        "sp_00013473827456470532303387361290",
        "sp_09830498509887687644434677889098"
    ],
    "custom_reference": "5988920e-4609-4658-ae97-11f44ea14c6f"
}
```

```

## Dangerous Goods Ruleset

This object is used to update and retrieve an existing dangerous goods `ruleset`.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Validation | Occurrence |

</div>

## Dangerous Goods Ruleset Summary

This object provides a summary view of a dangerous goods `ruleset`.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | :--------: |
| `reference` | `string` | The unique reference for this `ruleset` provided by Sorted. | `1` |
| `description` | `string` | The description for this `ruleset` set by the customer | `1` |
| `validity` | [`date_range`](#date-range) | The validity period for this `ruleset`, if applicable | `0..1` |

| `linked_carrier_services` | `integer` | The number of carrier services that this `ruleset` is linked to | `1` |

</div>

## Date Range

The `date_range` object is used to indicate a period of time. The object may include any combination of values:

- A `start` **and** `end` indicates a complete range of dates (inclusive)
- A `start` **only** indicates an open-ended date range, starting from a particular date (inclusive)
- An `end` **only** indicates a date range with a fixed endpoint (inclusive)

> [!NOTE]
> The property `has_value` was included during development of the Shipments MVP and was not originally part of the specification. However, we now have a customer actively using this data contract and the property can no longer be removed. This is a great example of the dangers of extending data types - it suddenly becomes a property we're stuck with, whether we like it or not.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Validation | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | :--------: |
| `start` | `ISO8601 Date Time` | The start of the date period, inclusive. | Optional. If provided, must be prior to equal to the `end` | `0..1` |
| `end` | `ISO8601 Date Time` | The end of the date period, inclusive. | Optional. If provided, must be later than or equal to the `start` | `0..1` |
| `has_value` | `boolean` | Indicates whether the object has a value or not. | Not applicable to requests. | `1` |

</div>

### Date Range JSON Examples

The following example shows an open-ended `date_range` â€“ i.e. the date range covers the period from the start to any point in the future:

```json
{
    "required_delivery_date": {
        "start": "2019-04-27T07:00:00+01:00",
        "end": null
    }
}
```

The following example shows a `date_range` with no fixed start, but a fixed end:

```json
{
    "required_delivery_date": {
        "start": null,
        "end": "2019-04-27T07:00:00+01:00"
    }
}
```

The following example shows a specific `date_range`, with a fixed start and end:

```json
{
    "required_delivery_date": {
        "start": "2019-04-26T00:00:00+01:00",
        "end": "2019-04-27T23:00:00+01:00"
    }
}
```

## Dimensions

The `dimensions` object is used to specify the dimensions of the contents of a `shipment`. The `dimensions` object contains both the individual dimensions and the unit of measurement.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Validation | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | :--------: |
| `length` | `decimal` | The length in the specified units. | Required. Must be a valid positive decimal. Values are saved by SortedPRO with a precision of up to 5 decimal places. `Length` should be the **longest** of the three dimensions provided. **Sorted will re-arrange dimensions if your request does not follow this rule**. | `1` |
| `height` | `decimal` | The height in the specified units. | Required. Must be a valid positive decimal. | `1` |
| `width` | `decimal` | The height in the specified units. | Required. Must be a valid positive decimal. | `1` |
| `unit` | [`dimension_unit`](#dimension-unit) | The unit of measurement. | Required. Must be a valid [`dimension_unit`](#dimension-unit). **Note**: all units specified within a single `shipment` **must** be the same, i.e. customers *cannot* combine `dimension_unit` values within a single `shipment`. | 1 |

</div>

### Dimensions JSON Examples

The following example shows how `dimensions` can be defined in `JSON`:

```json
{
    "dimensions": {
        "unit": "cm",
        "width": 15.0,
        "height": 15.5,
        "length": 20.0
    }
}
```

By using an alternative `unit`, the `dimensions` can be expressed in inches:

```json
{
    "dimensions": {
        "unit": "in",
        "width": 5.91,
        "height": 6.10,
        "length": 7.874
    }
}
```

## Dimension Unit

Represents the dimension units recognised by SortedPRO.

> [!NOTE]
> This list of values may be extended at any time without prior notice. Your application should not be coded in such a way that an addition to the list causes a breaking change.

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `cm` | Centimetres |
| `in` | Inches |

## Direction

The `direction` property of a `shipment` indicates whether the `shipment` is intended to be sent to a consumer or received by a consumer.

Generally, a return will have a `direction` of `inbound` and all other `shipments` will have a `direction` of `outbound`.

If not provided, the `direction` property will always default to `outbound`.

> [!NOTE]
> This list of values may be extended at any time without prior notice. Your application should not be coded in such a way that an addition to the list causes a breaking change.

| Value | Description |
|------ | ------------|
| `outbound` | The `shipment` is sent to a consumer. This does not have to be a direct `shipment` â€“ it is possible that the `shipment` is an `on_demand` `shipment` from a location not under the customer's control. |
| `inbound` | The `shipment` is intended to be sent by a consumer (e.g. the `shipment` is being returned) |

## Document

[!include[_document](includes/_document.md)]

## Document Type

The following table provides details of the `document_types` support in Sorted APIs:

| Value | Description |
|------ | ------------|
| `label` | The document is a shipping label |
| `cn22` | The document is a CN22 form. |
| `cn23` | The document is a CN23 form. |
| `commercial_invoice` | The document is a commercial invoice. |
| `collection_note` | The document is a collection note (driver's manifest) |
| `hazard_label` | The document relates to hazardous or dangerous goods |

## Excluded Service

The `excluded_service` object provides details of carrier services that were unable to provide quotes. There are many reasons why a carrier service may not be able to provide a quote for any given `shipment` and this object provides high-level details.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | :--------: |
| `carrier` | [`carrier_details`](#carrier-details) | Details of the carrier and service that this record relates to. | `1` |
| `exclusion` | [`exclusion`](#exclusion) | Details of the reason for exclusion. | `1` |

</div>

## Exclusion

The `exclusion` object provides details of the reasons for exclusion of a carrier or carrier service when generating quotes.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | :--------: |
| `reason` | `string` | A plain text reason for the exclusion of this carrier or carrier service. | `1` |
| `code` | [`exclusion_code`](#exclusion-code) | A specific code identifying why a carrier or carrier service was unable to provide a quote. | `1` |

</div>

## Exclusion Code

The following table lists the current `exclusion_code` values available in Sorted.

| Value | Description |
|------ | ------------|
| `ex_availability` | The carrier reported that it does not have availability to carry the `shipment`. |
| `ex_rates` | The carrier does not have a configured rate for this `shipment`. |
| `ex_contents` | The carrier does not support the contents of the `shipment`. This could be due to dangerous or hazardous contents, for example. |
| `ex_weight` | The carrier does not support a `shipment` with the given weight. |
| `ex_dims` | The carrier does not support a `shipment` with the given dimensions. |
| `ex_rules` | The carrier has been excluded by your configured allocation rules. |
| `ex_timeout` | The carrier did not respond within a given request time out value. |

        }
    ]
}
```

## LatLong

The `lat_long` property is used to capture the latitude and longitude of an address, if applicable. Although individual properties can be set to zero, `0,0` is **not** a valid value for the object.

<div class="contract">

| `type` | `string` | The type of resource that this `link` points to. See [`resource_type`](#resource-type). | `1` |

</div>

## Manifest

The `manifest` object contains details of a collection of `shipments` that were manifested in a single operation. This can be as a result of manifesting by query, manifesting by an explicit list of `shipment` references, or by an automatic manifest operation.

<div class="contract">

</div>

## Manifest Query Request

A `manifest_query_request` is used when manifesting one or more `shipments` using a query. Rather than provide individual `shipment` references, the request uses various parameters to identify `shipments` that should be manifested.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Validation | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | :--------: |
| `shipping_locations` | List of `string` | A list of shipping location references used to identify `shipments`. Only `shipments` originating from these location(s) will be selected. | Optional.

```

## Manifest Request

A `manifest_request` is used to manually manifest one or more `shipments` that are in a valid `state` to be manifested with the carrier.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Validation | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | :--------: |
| `shipments` | List of `string` | References of one or more `shipments` to manifest | Required. Must include 1 or more valid existing `shipment` references. A maximum of `100` `shipments` can be manifested at once using this method. | `1..100` |

</div>

### Manifest Request JSON Example

A `manifest_request` is used to request that one or more `shipments` should be manifested:

```json
{
    "shipments": [
        "sp_10014417511430946819000009890989",
        "sp_10014417515725914112653748572891",
        "sp_10014417515725914113647485930221"
    ]
}
```

## Manifest Response

A `manifest_response` is returned when a request is made to manifest one or more `shipments`. The `manifest_result` objects within the response will be grouped by carrier or carrier service.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | :--------: |
| `results` | List of [`manifest_result`](#manifest-result) | Details of the result of the manifest operation for each `shipment` in the request. | `1..n` |

</div>

### Manifest Response JSON Example

A `manifest_response` is sent in response to a `manifest_request` and provides details of the success, or otherwise, of the request to manifest `shipments`:

```json
{
    "manifest_results": [
        {
            "reference": " ma_10014418692546953216767678909876",

                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Manifest Result

A `manifest_result` provides details of the result of a manifest operation for a single `shipment`. Multiple `manifest_results` are returned as part of a [`manifest_response`](#manifest-response).

<div class="contract">

</div>

## Metadata

`Metadata` is used in SortedPRO as a collection of properties that customers define, rather than fixed fields or properties defined by Sorted. SortedPRO may include functional extensions in the future that provide new functionality based on `metadata`.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Validation | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | :--------: |
| `key` | `string` | The `key` of this `metadata` item. | Required. Each `metadata` key must be unique within a `metadata` collection. The length of the `key` must be `>= 1` and `<= 50` characters. | `1` |

### Metadata JSON Example

The following example shows how `metadata` can be used to add additional properties to a `shipment`:

> [!TIP]
> In this example there is a string property with the `key` "warehouse_id" and a custom `value`. There is also a `boolean` item with the `key` "refundable" which has a value of `false`. This object allows the storage of custom attributes for a `shipment` that might be used for logical decision-making in in the future.

```json
{
    "metadata": [
        {
            "key": "warehouse_id",
            "value": "WHF-0098762345D",
            "type": "string"
        },
        {
            "key": "refundable",
            "value": "false",
            "type": "boolean"
        }
    ]
}
```

## Metadata Type

This property is used to indicate the type of value provided with a particular `metadata` item. This may be used by future SortedPRO features to enable logic-based operations on provided `metadata`. If not provided, the value of `metadata_type` will default to `string`.

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `string` | The `metadata` value is a `string`. The provided value must have a length `>= 1` and `<= 100`. No further validation will be performed on the provided value. |
| `bool` | The `metadata` value indicates a `boolean` value. The provided value must be one of `true | false`. The value can be provided in any case (e.g. `FALSE`, `false`, `False`) but will be converted to lowercase by SortedPRO when saved. |
| `date_time_offset` | The `metadata` value is an `ISO8601 Date Time` (including offset). The provided value will be validated to ensure that it is a valid `ISO8601 Date Time` value. |
| `integer` | The `metadata` value is an `integer`. The provided value will be validated to ensure that is it a valid `integer` between `-2,147,483,648` and `2,147,483,647` |
| `decimal` | The `metadata` value is a `decimal`. The provided value will be validated to ensure that it is a valid `decimal` number. |
| `url` | A URL provided as a `string`. |

## Operator

### Shipment JSON Example

A `shipment` has more properties than a `create_shipment_request`, because Sorted will populate properties based on the operations conducted on the `shipment`. For example, Sorted will assign a unique reference to the `shipment`, and once the `shipment` is allocated it will contain details of the allocation:

```json

## Shipment Contents

All `shipments` in SortedPRO require at least one `shipment_contents` object. This object represents the contents of the `shipment`. For example, a `shipment` of a pair of shoes will contain one `shipment_contents` object which defines the properties of the pair of shoes (e.g. `dimensions`, `weight`, etc.).

<div class="contract">

## Shipment Group

A `shipment_group` is used to group together `shipments` booked with the same carrier service. This object is used to manage a `shipment_group` that has already been created.

<div class="contract">

| `updated` | `ISO8601 Date Time` | The date and time that this `shipment_group` was last updated. | `0..1` |

</div>

### Shipment Group JSON Example

A `shipment_group` is created as a result of a `create_shipment_group_request` and includes the unique reference assigned by Sorted and the current state of the `shipment_group`:

```json
{
    "reference": "sg_10014417970992447488787654333231",
    "shipments": [
        "sp_00013473827456470532303387361290",
        "sp_09830498509898987009909000543435"
    ],
    "custom_reference": "5988920e-4609-4658-ae97-11f44ea14c6f",
    "state": "open",
    "created": "2019-05-03T17:00:23+01:00"
}

```

## Shipment Group State

The following table lists the possible `state` values for a [`shipment_group`](#shipment-group).

| Value | Description |
|------ | ------------|
| `open` | The `shipment_group` is open and additional `shipments` can be added to or removed from the group. The `shipment_group` may not be used to retrieve a `collection_note` whilst in this `state`. |
| `locked` | The `shipment_group` is `locked`, and no further `shipments` can be added to or removed from the group. The `collection_note` may now be generated. |
| `closed` | The `shipment_group` has been `closed`. No further operations may be conducted on the `shipment_group`, but the `collection_note` and `shipment_group` details may still be retrieved. |

## Shipment Group Summary

The `shipment_group_summary` object provides summary details of a [`shipment_group`](#shipment-group).

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | :--------: |

## Shipment State Change Request

A `shipment_state_change_request` can be used to modify the `state` of a `shipment` manually. Only certain `state` transitions are permitted. This functionality should be used in exceptional circumstances when Sorted is unable to transition a `state` automatically (e.g. due to unavailable tracking details).

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Validation | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | :--------: |
| `reference` | `string` | The reference of the `shipment` to change | Required. Must be a valid `shipment` reference for an existing `shipment`. | `1` |
| `state` | [`shipment_state`](#shipment-state) | The desired [`shipment_state`](#shipment-state). | Required. Must be a valid [`shipment_state`](#shipment-state). | `1` |
| `reason` | `string` | The reason for the change. This forms part of the `shipment's` audit history. | Required. Length `>= 5` and `<= 100` characters. | `1` |

</div>

### Shipment State Change Request JSON Example

A `shipment_state_change_request` is used to change the state of a `shipment`:

```json
{
    "shipment_reference": "sp_10014418735496626176778765666898",
    "state": "delivered",
    "reason": "Manually tracked by customer support"
}
```

## Shipment State Summary

A `shipment_state_summary` provides key properties of a `shipment` as it relates to a manifest.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | :--------: |
| `reference` | `string` | The unique reference for this `shipment`. | `1` |
| `state` | `shipment_state` | The current state of the `shipment`. | `1` |
| `_links` | List of [`link`](#link) | Provides links to related resources. | `0..n` |

</div>

## Shipment Summary

A `shipment_summary` is returned in a [`quote`](#quote) and provides summary details of the `shipment` that a `quote` relates to.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | :--------: |
| `reference` | `string` | The unique reference for this `shipment`. | `1` |
| `addresses` | List of [`address`](#address) | The addresses relating to this `shipment`. | `2..7` |
| `custom_reference` | `string` | The custom reference applied by the customer for this `shipment`. | `0..1` |
| `_links` | List of [`link`](#link) | Provides [`links`](#link) to any related resources. | `0..n` |

</div>

## Shipment Type

The `shipment_type` property indicates whether the `shipment` is intended to be allocated with an on-demand service or with a scheduled service, or both.

> [!NOTE]
> This list of values may be extended at any time without prior notice. Your application should not be coded in such a way that an addition to the list causes a breaking change.

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `on_demand` | The `shipment` is intended to be allocated to an on-demand service. An on-demand service is one which does not have a regular, scheduled collection from a pre-defined location. |
| `scheduled` | The `shipment` is intended to be allocated to a scheduled service. This is a service which has a predefined, scheduled time (or times) of collection from a specific location. |

The `shipment_type` property is used to determine which type(s) of carrier service to use when retrieving quotes or allocating a `shipment`. If you know before creation whether a `shipment` will be an on-demand or scheduled `shipment`, you should always prefer to specify the specific `shipment_type`. However, SortedPRO allows multiple `shipment_type` values to be specified by supplying multiple values separated by a comma. This means that you can indicate that a `shipment` should be eligible for both on-demand and scheduled collections.

> [!WARNING]
> Note that the more stringent validation rules will apply when specifying both `shipment_types`. For instance, a `shipping_location_reference` is required when using a type of `scheduled`, but not when specifying a type of `on_demand`. Therefore, if you specify `on_demand, scheduled` for this property then a `shipping_location_reference` will be required.

## Shipping Terms

The following values are permissible as `shipping_terms` when populating the [`customs_documentation`](#customs-documentation) property of a `shipment`.

> [!NOTE]
> This list of values may be extended at any time without prior notice. Your application should not be coded in such a way that an addition to the list causes a breaking change.

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `exw` | Ex Works (named place of delivery) |
| `fca` | Free Carrier (named place of delivery) |

## Tracking Response List

The `tracking_response_list` provides one or more [`tracking_responses`](#tracking-response). This object is generally returned in response to a query to retrieve tracking that may match more than one `shipment`.

> [!TIP]
> This object exists to ensure consistency of handling of JSON objects and to allow future extensibility. A simple array could be returned, but then it would not be possible to extend the response for an applicable API without introducing a breaking change.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | :--------: |
| `tracking_responses` | List of [`tracking_response`](#tracking-response) | The list of matching `tracking_response` objects. | `0..n` |
| `total_results` | `int` | The total number of matching results | `1` |
| `take` | `int` | The number of `tracking_responses` that were requested | `1` |
| `skip` | `int` | The number of `tracking_responses` that were skipped | `1` |
| `_links` | List of [`link`](#link) | Lists any related resources | `0..n` |

</div>

## Update Shipment Group Request

An `update_shipment_group_request` is used to update an existing `shipment_group` by modifying the `shipments` that the group contains.

## Update Shipment Request

The `update_shipment_request` is used to update an existing shipment.

> [!WARNING]
> All properties in an `update_shipment_request` should be provided when updating the `shipment` i.e. customers should provide the full details of the `shipment` rather than just including properties they wish to update. The properties provided will replace the *entire* `shipment` object. There are some system-generated properties of a `shipment` that cannot be modified, such as `allocation` and `_links`.

## Value

Represents the `value` of `contents` within a `shipment`. The va`lue property includes both the amount and the currency of the value.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Validation | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | :--------: |
| `amount` | `decimal` | The amount in the specified units. | Required. Must be a valid positive `decimal`. Values are saved by SortedPRO with a precision of up to 5 `decimal` places. | `1` |
| `currency` | `string` | The ISO code of the currency (3 characters). | Required. Must be a valid 3-character ISO code. | `1` |
| `discount_rate` | `decimal` | Used to indicate the proportion of discount. A value of `100` indicates `100%` discount. | Optional. If not provided, will default to `0`. If provided, must be a valid `decimal` between `0` and `100` representing the percentage discount e.g. `10.5` means `10.5%`. | `0..1` |

</div>

### Value JSON Examples

The following examples show how `value` can be expressed in different currencies:

```json
{
    "value": {
        "amount": 8.99,
        "currency": "GBP"
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "value": {
        "amount": 9.99,
        "currency": "USD"
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "value": {
        "amount": 11.00,
        "currency": "EUR"
    }
}
```

It is also possible to apply a discount to the `value` of goods. This is useful if the goods have no effective `value` or cost to the customer. Customs documentation and carriers may still require a `value` greater than `0` to be provided. The `discount` property is designed to allow customers to indicate *actual* and *effective* `values`:

```json
{
    "value": {
        "amount": 11.00,
        "currency": "EUR",
        "discount": 90
    }
}
```

To indicate a value of `100%`, a value of `100` should be provided for the `discount` property:

```json
{
    "value": {
        "amount": 11.00,
        "currency": "EUR",
        "discount": 100
    }
}
```

## Weight

The `weight` object is used to define the `weight` of items within a `shipment`. `Weight` contains both the value and the unit of measurement.

> [!WARNING]
> All units specified within a single `shipment` must be the same, i.e. you cannot combine `weight_unit` values within a single `shipment`.

<div class="contract">

| Property | Type | Description | Validation | Occurrence |
| -------- | ---- | ----------- | ---------- | :--------: |
| `value` | `decimal` | The value in the specified units. | Required. Must be a valid positive `decimal`. Values are saved by SortedPRO with a precision of up to `5` decimal places. | `1` |
| `unit` | [`weight_unit`](#weight-unit) | The unit of measurement. | Required. Must be a valid [`weight_unit`](#weight-unit). | `1` |

</div>

### Weight JSON Examples

The following example shows how a standard `weight` objects can be defined in `JSON`. The item weighs `2.4kg`:

```json
{
    "weight": {
        "value": 2.40,
    "unit": "kg"
    }
}
```

By specifying an alternative `unit`, the `weight` can be expressed in `pounds`:

```json
{
    "weight": {
        "value": 5.29,
        "unit": "lb"
    }
}
```

## Weight Unit

Represents the weight units recognised by SortedPRO.

> [!NOTE]
> This list of values may be extended at any time without prior notice. Your application should not be coded in such a way that an addition to the list causes a breaking change.

| Value | Description |
| ----- | ----------- |
| `kg` | Kilograms |
| `lb` | Pounds |

> [!TIP]
> *Metric and imperial combinations*
>
> When defining the `weight` and `dimensions` of a `shipment`, customers must either use **all** imperial or **all** metric units, i.e. it is **not** possible to combine a `weight_unit` of `lb` and a `dimension_unit` of `cm`. The current accepted combinations are:
>
>
> | Dimension Unit | Weight Unit |
> | -------------- | ----------- |
> | `cm` | `kg` |
> | `in` | `lb` |
