# Getting Started

How to access the Sorted PRO reports, and select the report you need.

## Accessing the App

The Sorted PRO reports are published as a self-contained Microsoft Power BI app. The app runs via the web-based Power BI Service - you don't need to install any software to view PRO reports.

We provide each PRO customer with one Power BI Pro license, which grants them access to view the reports. When you sign up for the service, you'll need to give us the email address of the user you want to assign that license to. We'll then set them up and send them an access link to the reports.

> The access link is unique to an individual user - it won't work for anyone who has not been granted specific access and the relevant Power BI license.

Click the access link to open the reports. Alternatively, you can access the reports from within Power BI by clicking **Shared with me** from the left-hand toolbar and selecting **Multi-Company Customer Report** from the list of shared reports.

## Viewing Reports

When you open the app, the **Traffic Profile** report is displayed. To select other reports in the collection, use the tabs at the bottom of the screen.

Each PRO report is a collection of data visualisations (such as charts, tables, and maps) that gives you a graphical overview of a particular aspect of your shipping performance. For example, the **Volumes by Carrier** report features a table listing how many consignments and packages each of your carriers has shipped, a pie chart showing the share of your total shipments each carrier has, and a chart showing each carrier's total shipments over time.

</a>

These three visualisations enable you to get a picture of how much of your shipment volume each carrier is handing.

The PRO reports are dynamic, enabling you to filter the data displayed on each visualisation, and in some cases drill down to the raw data itself.
