# Traffic Profile

The **Traffic Profile** report shows how many consignments that your organisation has manifested in a given timeframe, and the weights of the consignments manifested. It comprises a table listing consignment and packages data, and two bar charts: **Consignment Volume Distribution by Absolute Weight** and **Consignment Volume Distribution by Volumetric Weight**.
