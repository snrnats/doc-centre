# Traffic Profile

The **Traffic Profile** report gives a summary of the number of consignments that your organisation has manifested in a given timeframe, and the weights of the consignments manifested. It comprises a table listing consignment and packages data, and two bar charts: **Consignment Volume Distribution by Absolute Weight** and **Consignment Volume Distribution by Volumetric Weight**.

## Consignment Volume Distribution by Absolute Weight Chart

The **Consignment Volume Distribution by Absolute Weight** chart displays the weight distribution of your manifested consignments, with weight in kg on its x-axis and frequency on its y-axis. It is intended to help you identify trends in the weights of the consignments you manifest.
